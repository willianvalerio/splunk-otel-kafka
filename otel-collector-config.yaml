  # Enabling the memory_limiter is strongly recommended for every pipeline.

  # The configuration below assumes 2GB of memory. In general, the ballast
  # should be set to 1/3 of the collector's memory, the limit should be 90% of
  # the collector's memory up to 2GB, and the spike should be 25% of the
  # collector's memory up to 2GB. In addition, the "--mem-ballast-size-mib" CLI
  # flag must be set to the same value as the "ballast_size_mib". For more
  # information, see
